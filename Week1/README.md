# Threading

- The folder warmups contains multithreaded programs for you to refer to for syntax and hints.
- Your task is to implement vectorised matrix multiplication in the file `Task/Parallel.cpp`.
- You have to achieve a speedup similiar to the one shown in graph, obviously an exact replica is impossible
- Feel free to edit any files other than `driver.cpp` and `Naive.cpp`
- Generate your graph and save it as `graph.png`
- Upload your work back to github, we would love to see the kind of speedup you guys have achieved!
- Before moving on to this do check out the warmups and there are a few basic questions for you to try there as well.
- Compile warmup questions using `g++ Ex1.cpp -o Ex1 && g++ Ex2.cpp -o Ex2 && g++ Ex3.cpp -o Ex3`
- Observe the outputs for all kinds of values of n
- Run the makefile to test your implementation.
